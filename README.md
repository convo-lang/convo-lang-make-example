# Convo-Make Example
This is project is a very simple example of using the **Convo-Make** generative build system.

Convo-Make is similar to the [make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)) build command and
[Terraform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraform_(software)).
`.convo` files and Markdown files are used to generate outputs that could be anything from React
components to images or videos.

Convo-Make provides for a declarative way to generated applications and content with fine grain control
over the context of used for generation. Generating content with Convo-Make is repeatable, easy to
modify and minimizes the number of tokens and time required to generate large applications
since outputs are cached and generated in parallel.

You can basically think of it as file the is generated is generated by it's own Claude sub agent.

7. Watch the magic happen ðŸª„

## What does the make.convo file do?
The `make.convo` file defines the following steps:

- Generates a detailed description of the "Beach Rescue" app using a short description defined in the `convo/vars.convo` file
- Generates a pages.json that will be used by following steps to generated pages
- Generates a detailed descripion of each page in pages.json and saves them to `docs/pages/*.md`
- Genreates a NextJS page for each description in the `docs/pages` directory.


This example is very simple and generates 2 NextJS pages. It kept simple and generates a small number
 of files to make it quick to test.
